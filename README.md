A comprehensive course on programming abstractions, data structures, and object-oriented programming using Java. This repository contains materials for learning advanced programming concepts through practical implementation and problem-solving.

## Course Overview

Computing continues to play an ever-increasing role in today's society. Understanding computational thinking and programming is essential for professionals across industries, from technology-driven sectors to scientific research and informed citizenship in our digital world.

This course builds upon foundational programming knowledge, focusing on data structures and object-oriented programming principles. It assumes prior experience with programming fundamentals including control structures, variables, data types, and arrays.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, participants will be able to:

### Computational Thinking
- Decompose complex problems into manageable subproblems
- Design and express algorithms using structured methodologies
- Evaluate design trade-offs and solution efficiency

### Data Structures Implementation
- Implement and utilize fundamental data structures:
  - Lists and ArrayLists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Maps and Dictionaries
  - Sets and Collections
- Select appropriate data structures for specific problem domains
- Analyze time and space complexity of data structure operations

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Design and implement Java classes with proper encapsulation
- Create compound data types and custom objects
- Establish relationships between classes using interfaces and inheritance
- Apply abstraction principles to separate interface from implementation

### Code Quality and Maintenance
- Write readable, maintainable Java code following established conventions
- Implement comprehensive testing strategies
- Debug complex programs using systematic approaches
- Document code effectively for long-term maintainability

## Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is organized around 17 specific learning objectives across seven major themes:

### 1. Computational Thinking
- **Problem Decomposition:** Break complex problems into solvable components
- **Algorithm Design:** Create structured solutions using pseudocode and flowcharts

### 2. Code Comprehension
- **Program Tracing:** Follow execution flow through complex data structures
- **Behavior Prediction:** Anticipate program output and state changes

### 3. Code Implementation
- **Functional Correctness:** Write programs that meet specified requirements
- **I/O Operations:** Handle console input/output and file operations
- **Data Structure Selection:** Choose appropriate structures for specific problems
- **Class Design:** Create well-structured Java classes and interfaces

### 4. Communication
- **Program Documentation:** Clearly describe program behavior and functionality
- **Method Specification:** Document class methods with input/output specifications
- **Code Documentation:** Create maintainable documentation for programs and classes

### 5. Testing
- **Correctness Verification:** Evaluate programs against specifications
- **Test Case Design:** Create comprehensive test suites for validation

### 6. Debugging
- **Error Identification:** Systematically locate and diagnose program issues
- **Problem Resolution:** Implement effective fixes for identified errors
