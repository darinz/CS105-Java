# Programming Assignment 1: Student Grade Manager

## Overview
In this assignment, you will create a comprehensive Student Grade Manager system that demonstrates your understanding of Java File I/O concepts. The program will read student data from files, process grades, and generate formatted reports.

**Estimated Time:** 90 minutes  
**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate  
**Focus Areas:** File I/O, Scanner, Exception Handling, Data Processing

## Learning Objectives
- Read data from text files using Scanner
- Write formatted output to files using PrintStream
- Handle file exceptions gracefully
- Process different data types from file input
- Implement data validation and error checking
- Create structured, maintainable code

## Assignment Structure

### Part 1: Student Data Reader (30 minutes)
Create a program that reads student information from a text file and validates the data.

### Part 2: Grade Calculator (30 minutes)
Implement a grade calculation system that processes student scores and computes final grades.

### Part 3: Report Generator (30 minutes)
Generate formatted reports and save them to output files.

## Files Provided
- `StudentGradeManager.java` - Main program file with starter code
- `students.txt` - Sample input file with student data
- `grades.txt` - Sample input file with grade data
- `expected_output.txt` - Example of expected output format

## Submission Requirements
- Complete implementation of all three parts
- Proper exception handling
- Clean, well-commented code
- Test with provided sample files
- Submit all source files and generated output files

## Grading Criteria
- **Functionality (60%)**: Program works correctly with provided test files
- **Code Quality (25%)**: Clean, readable, well-structured code
- **Error Handling (15%)**: Proper exception handling and user feedback

## Getting Started
1. Review the provided starter code in `StudentGradeManager.java`
2. Examine the sample input files to understand the data format
3. Implement each part incrementally, testing as you go
4. Use the provided test cases to verify your implementation

Good luck!
