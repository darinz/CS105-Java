# equals() method

The `equals()` method in Java is used to compare two objects for *equality*. But what does equality mean? By default, it means both references point to the exact same object in memory (reference equality). However, in many cases, we want to check if two objects have the same *values* (value equality).

## Why is `equals()` important?
- Used by many Java library methods, such as `contains`, `remove`, and `indexOf` in collections like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`.
- Determines how objects are compared for equality in your code.

## Default Implementation
Every class in Java inherits a default `equals()` method from the `Object` class:

```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    return (this == obj); // Checks if both references point to the same object in memory
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `this == obj` checks if both variables refer to the exact same object (reference equality).
- This does **not** compare the contents or values inside the objects.

## Overriding `equals()` for Value Equality
If you want to compare objects based on their values (fields), you need to override `equals()` in your class.

### Example: Comparing Points
Suppose we have a `Point` class:

```java
public class Point {
    private int x; // x-coordinate
    private int y; // y-coordinate

    // Constructor to initialize the point
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    // Overriding equals() for value equality
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        // Step 1: Check if both references are the same
        if (this == obj) return true;
        // Step 2: Check if obj is null or not the same class
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        // Step 3: Cast obj to Point and compare fields
        Point other = (Point) obj;
        return this.x == other.x && this.y == other.y;
    }
}
```
**Step-by-step explanation:**
- `if (this == obj) return true;`  
  If both references point to the same object, they are equal.
- `if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;`  
  If `obj` is `null` or not a `Point`, they can't be equal.
- `Point other = (Point) obj;`  
  Safe to cast now, since we know it's a `Point`.
- `return this.x == other.x && this.y == other.y;`  
  Compare the actual data fields for equality.

### Using `instanceof` (Alternative)
You can also use `instanceof` for more flexible type checking (allows subclasses):

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) return true; // Same reference
    if (!(obj instanceof Point)) return false; // Not a Point
    Point other = (Point) obj; // Safe cast
    return this.x == other.x && this.y == other.y; // Compare fields
}
```
**Note:**
- `instanceof` allows subclasses to be considered equal, which may or may not be what you want. Using `getClass()` is stricter.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Forgetting to override `hashCode()`**: If you override `equals()`, you *must* also override `hashCode()`. Otherwise, your objects may not work correctly in hash-based collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`.
- **Not checking for null**: Always check if the parameter is `null` before casting.
- **Using `==` for objects**: Use `equals()` for object value comparison, not `==` (which checks reference equality).

## Example: hashCode() Implementation
```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    // Generates a hash code based on x and y values
    return Objects.hash(x, y);
}
```
- `Objects.hash(x, y)` is a utility method (Java 7+) that combines the fields into a single hash code.
- Ensures that equal objects have the same hash code, as required by the contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()`.

## Summary Table
| Comparison Type      | Method         | Checks for           |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Reference Equality  | `==`           | Same object in memory|
| Value Equality      | `equals()`     | Same field values    |

## Key Takeaways
- Use `equals()` to compare object values, not references.
- Always override `hashCode()` when you override `equals()`.
- Follow best practices to avoid bugs in collections and comparisons.
