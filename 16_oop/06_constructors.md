# Constructors

Constructors are special methods in Java that are called when we first create a new instance (object) of a class. Their main job is to initialize the object's fields (variables) with values, either default or provided by the user.

---

## Why Do We Need Constructors?

When you create an object, you often want to set up its initial state. Constructors let you do this automatically, so every object starts out correctly set up.

```java
// Example: Creating a Point object
Point p = new Point(); // Calls the constructor of the Point class
```
*Above: This line creates a new Point object by calling its constructor. The constructor sets up the initial values for the object's fields.*

---

## The Default Constructor

If you **donâ€™t write any constructors** in your class, Java automatically provides a default constructor. This constructor takes no parameters and sets each field to its default value (e.g., 0 for numbers, false for booleans, null for objects).

```java
public class Point {
    int x; // default value is 0
    int y; // default value is 0
    // No constructor written, so Java provides:
    // public Point() { }
}

Point p = new Point(); // x and y are both 0
```
*Above: Since we didn't write a constructor, Java gives us a default one. The fields x and y are set to 0 automatically.*

---

## Writing Your Own Constructor

You can write your own constructor to set the fields to specific values when the object is created.

**Constructor Syntax:**

```java
public class Point {
    int x;
    int y;

    // This is a constructor
    public Point(int initialX, int initialY) {
        x = initialX; // Set the field x to the value of initialX
        y = initialY; // Set the field y to the value of initialY
    }
}

Point p = new Point(3, 4); // x = 3, y = 4
```
*Above: The constructor lets us set the starting values for x and y when we create the object. Here, p.x is 3 and p.y is 4.*

---

## Important: If You Write Any Constructor

If you write **any** constructor (even one that takes parameters), Java will **not** provide a default constructor for you. If you still want a no-argument constructor, you must write it yourself.

```java
public class Point {
    int x;
    int y;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x; // 'this.x' refers to the field, 'x' is the parameter
        this.y = y;
    }

    // No-argument constructor (must write it yourself)
    public Point() {
        x = 0; // Set x to 0 by default
        y = 0; // Set y to 0 by default
    }
}
```
*Above: If you want to allow both Point() and Point(3, 4), you must write both constructors. Otherwise, Point() would not work if you only wrote the parameterized one.*

---

## Common Mistake: Shadowing Field Names

If you use the same parameter names as your field names, you need to use `this` to refer to the fields of the object:

```java
public class Point {
    int x;
    int y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x; // 'this.x' is the field, 'x' is the parameter
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```
*Above: Using `this.x` makes it clear you are setting the object's field, not just the parameter. If you wrote `x = x;`, it would do nothing!* 

---

## Constructor Overloading

You can have multiple constructors in a class, as long as they have different parameter lists. This is called **constructor overloading**.

```java
public class Point {
    int x;
    int y;

    // No-argument constructor
    public Point() {
        x = 0; // Default value
        y = 0; // Default value
    }

    // Constructor with two parameters
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x; // Set x to the value passed in
        this.y = y; // Set y to the value passed in
    }
}

Point p1 = new Point();      // x = 0, y = 0
Point p2 = new Point(5, 10); // x = 5, y = 10
```
*Above: You can create a Point with no arguments (defaults to 0,0) or with specific values. Java knows which constructor to use based on the arguments you provide.*

---

## Summary
- **Constructors** initialize new objects.
- If you write any constructor, Java does **not** provide a default one.
- Use `this` to distinguish between fields and parameters with the same name.
- You can **overload** constructors to provide different ways to create objects.

*Tip: Constructors always have the same name as the class and no return type (not even void!).*
