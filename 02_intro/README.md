Welcome to the Introduction module of CS105 Java Programming! This section provides the foundational knowledge and skills needed to begin your journey in Java programming.

## Module Overview

This introduction covers essential Java concepts through a combination of theoretical learning and practical application. You'll learn the fundamentals of Java programming while building a complete Minesweeper game as a case study.

## Learning Materials

### 1. [Overview](./01_overview.md) - Java Fundamentals
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand Java program structure and syntax
- Master the `main` method and entry points
- Learn printing methods and comments
- Explore variables, data types, and expressions
- Practice control structures (loops and conditionals)

**Key Concepts:**
- Java program structure and file naming conventions
- Primitive data types and variable declaration
- Output methods (`println`, `print`, `printf`)
- Control flow with `if/else` statements and loops
- Basic input/output operations

### 2. [Case Study](./02_case-study.md) - From Basics to Minesweeper
**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply Java concepts to solve real programming problems
- Understand array bounds and loop logic
- Learn through practical examples and debugging
- Build a complete Minesweeper game

**Key Concepts:**
- Array indexing and bounds checking
- Exception handling (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)
- Game development principles
- Algorithm design and implementation
- 2D arrays and game board representation

### 3. [Functional Decomposition](./03_functional_decomposition.md) - Breaking Down Complex Problems
**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn to break complex problems into manageable pieces
- Understand method design and organization
- Practice creating focused, single-purpose methods
- Develop systematic problem-solving approaches

**Key Concepts:**
- Problem decomposition strategies

- Real-world application through Minesweeper implementation

### 4. [Code Quality](./04_code_quality.md) - Writing Professional Code
**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn Java naming conventions and best practices
- Understand the importance of readable, maintainable code
- Practice writing self-documenting code
- Develop professional coding habits

**Key Concepts:**
- Java naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
- Code readability and maintainability
- Commenting and documentation
- Professional coding standards
- Code review principles

### 5. [Practice, Reviews, and Applications](./05_practice-review-app.md) - Hands-on Practice
**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply all learned concepts through practical exercises
- Build complete programs from scratch
- Practice problem-solving and debugging
- Reinforce understanding through hands-on coding

**Key Concepts:**
- Temperature converter application
- Number guessing game
- Array manipulation exercises
- Input validation and error handling
- Complete program development

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Write basic Java programs** with proper structure and syntax  
- **Use variables, data types, and expressions** effectively  
- **Implement control structures** (loops and conditionals)  
- **Break down complex problems** into manageable methods  
- **Write readable, maintainable code** following Java conventions  
- **Build complete applications** from requirements  
- **Debug and troubleshoot** common programming errors  
- **Apply programming concepts** to real-world problems

## Getting Started

1. **Start with the Overview** - Begin with `01_overview.md` to learn Java fundamentals
2. **Study the Case Study** - Review `02_case-study.md` to see concepts in action
3. **Learn Functional Decomposition** - Read `03_functional_decomposition.md` for problem-solving strategies
4. **Understand Code Quality** - Study `04_code_quality.md` for professional coding practices
5. **Practice and Apply** - Complete exercises in `05_practice-review-app.md`

## Tips for Success

- **Code along** with the examples in each document
- **Complete all practice exercises** to reinforce learning
- **Build the Minesweeper game** as you progress through the materials
- **Review and refactor** your code to improve quality
- **Ask questions** when concepts are unclear
- **Practice regularly** to build programming confidence

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
