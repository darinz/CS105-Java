# Mini Checkpoint Project 2

- Assignments are open-ended to encourage creativity
- Opportunity to investigate new concepts and real-world uses
- Emphasis on practicing with ArrayLists
- Designed to be completed in about 60 minutes at an intermediate level

## Project Instructions

### Overview
In this mini project, you will design and implement a small Java application that uses ArrayLists to solve a real-world problem or explore a creative idea. The goal is to practice using ArrayLists in a meaningful context, while also thinking about how to structure your code and make it user-friendly.

### How to Approach This Project
1. **Choose a Theme:**
   - Pick a simple application idea that interests you. Example ideas:
     - To-do list manager
     - Contact manager
     - Inventory tracker
     - Playlist manager
2. **Plan Your Features:**
   - Decide on at least three operations your app will support (e.g., add, remove, display/search).
   - Sketch a simple menu for user interaction.
3. **Start Coding:**
   - Use an `ArrayList` to store your main data (tasks, contacts, items, etc.).
   - Implement the menu using a loop and `Scanner` for user input.
   - Write methods for each operation to keep your code organized.
4. **Test as You Go:**
   - Run your program after adding each feature to make sure it works.
   - Handle possible errors (e.g., removing an item that doesn’t exist).
5. **Keep It Simple:**
   - Focus on getting a working version within 60 minutes. Don’t worry about advanced features or perfect design.

### Deliverables
- A single Java file with your code (e.g., `MiniProject.java`)
- A short (2-3 sentence) comment at the top describing what your app does

### Tips for Success
- Use clear variable names and add comments to explain your code.
- Break your code into methods to avoid repeating yourself.
- Test your app with different inputs to make sure it handles errors gracefully.
- If you get stuck, refer to the provided starter code (`MiniProject.java`) or the sample solution (`MiniProjectSolution.java`).

If you finish early, try adding an extra feature or improving the user interface.
