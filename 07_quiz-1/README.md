## Questions

### 1. Functional Decomposition

Suppose you are asked to write a program that prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
- Decompose this problem into at least two methods (other than `main`).
- Write the method signatures and briefly describe what each method does.
- Then, write the code for the method that actually computes the sum.

### 2. File I/O

Write a Java code snippet that reads a file called `data.txt` and prints each line that contains the word `"ERROR"`.
- Assume the file is in the same directory as your program.
- You may use either `Scanner` or `BufferedReader` for file reading.

### 3. ArrayLists

Write a Java method that takes an `ArrayList<Integer>` as a parameter and returns a new `ArrayList<Integer>` containing only the elements that are greater than 10.
- Write the method signature and the method body.
